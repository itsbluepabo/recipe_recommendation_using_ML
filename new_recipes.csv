To make whole wheat chapati recipe, combine the whole wheat flour, oil and salt and knead into a smooth soft dough using enough water. Keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes.

Cook the chapati on a non stick tava and then cook it on an open flame till it puffs up. This is how to make soft chapati.

I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect chapati recipe. 1. For making the chapati dough, take a deep bowl and add the flour to it.We need to take a deep bowl so that the flour and the other ingredients do not fall off while we are mixing or kneading the dough. 2. Some people like their chapatis bland ,so you can even skip adding salt to your chapati dough. 3. Add water little by little. Be careful while adding water.Adding too much of water initially will make it difficult for you to knead. 4. Apply a little oil on the surface of the dough before you keep it for resting, so that it doesn�t become dry. Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth. You can also use a food grade quality cling film or a plate to cover the dough. 5. Keep it aside for 15 minutes. This resting period improves the texture of the dough, makes it easier to roll and makes the chapatis softer and fluffier.

We love whole wheat chapati as its quick to make and very healthy. Made from the super ingredient whole wheat flour which is packed with phosphorus which is a major mineral which works closely with calcium to build our bones. Vitamin B9 helps your body to produce and maintain new cells, especially increase red blood cells which most your energy levels.

A lip-smacking chaat that is loved all over India, and now globally too, the chole tikki chaat is most enjoyed at roadside stalls, but is definitely more satisfying when you make it at home for your family or for a party.

Notes and tips on aloo tikki chole. 1. To make the Chole for the Chole Tikki Chaat, we first have to soak the kabuli chana. For that, wash the kabuli chana thoroughly under running water. Once washed, place them in a deep bowl. Cover them with enough water. We have taken approximately � cup of chickpeas as they will double on size once they are soaked and cooked. Cover the bowl with a plate and keep aside to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. This is a very important step as this not only helps in cooking the chickpeas faster but also helps in cooking them evenly. 2. If you want the chickpeas to go soft, you can add a pinch of baking soda while pressure cooking so that the chickpeas cook properly. But remember you do not want the chickpeas to go mushy. 3. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally before opening it. If you open it in a haste, the chickpeas will not have cooked properly. 4. Make sure that your pan is really hot so that you get a nice crust on your tikkis.

green chutney","dal vada recipe | chana dal vada | South Indian dal vada | paruppu vadai | with 25 amazing images

You will love the exciting crispness of these delectable dal vadas. Made with a coarse paste of soaked chana dal perked up with onions, ginger paste and the whole traditional team of flavour enhancers and deep fried, these South Indian dal vadas have a unique, rustic texture and warm, hearty flavour that will strike a chord with most people.

I would like to share some important tips to make chana dal vada. 1. Blend the chana dal to a coarse mixture without using any water. If required, once in between you can scrape the sides of the mixer jar and grind the mixture again. Try not to add water, as you will face difficulty in shaping the dal vada at a later stage. But if it is getting too problematic to grind, then add 1-2 tbsp of water. 2. Mix everything well and our paruppu vadai mixture is ready. Mixture should not be very moist or dry. If the mixture is too crumbly or too pasty then it would be difficult to make vadas from this mixture. If the mixture has turned crumbly, then grind it once again and if the mixture has turned pasty then add 1-2 tbsp of rice flour or besan to bind together all the ingredients. At this stage, you can taste the mixture and make the necessary changes in the flavour as per your liking. 3. Take care to deep-fry these South Indian dal vadas on a medium flame. Otherwise, they will quickly turn brown outside before they get cooked inside.

These deep fried dal vadas are sure to satiate you in a tasteful way, have them for Evening Tea Snacks accompained with Green Chutney or Tomato Coconut Chutney.

This wholesome dish is made with three different flours � jowar, whole wheat and besan. It is excitingly flavoured with lots of onion, garlic and coriander, which not only give an irresistible flavour and aroma but a lovely mouth-feel too.

You can go a step further and improvise it to your taste, by adding flavourers like mint, cumin seeds, or any other spices and seeds of your choice. We have added a little curd to give a tempting sourness to the dish, but you can avoid it if you do not want to.

Likewise, you can also make a paste of garlic and green chillies if you do not want to add them chopped. Sometimes, chopped green chillies can be irksome especially if kids will also be having the thalipeeth.

By the way, in case you are wondering why the dish is called Dhapate (which means slap or pat), your doubts will be dispelled once you read the procedure. This pancake is shaped by patting the dough with the hand. Earlier, they used to pat it directly on the hot tava with wet hands, but to make it easier we have shown you how to pat it on a plastic sheet and then transfer to the tava. This is much easier.

When the pan is moderately hot, dry roast coriander seeds on a slow flame for 3 minutes or till they release aroma and turn light brown in colour, while stirring continuously.

karanji recipe | Maharashtrian karanji | crispy rava karanji | Indian style coconut karanji is one of the best known traditional sweets of Maharashtra, the Karanji is a delightful treat of deep-fried plain flour shells loaded with a sweet and succulent filling of coconut, semolina, spices and nuts. Learn hot to make crispy rava karanji.

To make karanji, first make the stuffing. Heat a broad non-stick pan and dry roast the coconut on a medium flame for 1 to 2 minutes. Remove in a bowl and keep aside. In the same broad non-stick pan, heat the ghee, add the rava and saut� on a medium flame for 4 minutes. Add the poppy seeds and dry fruits and saut� on a medium flame for 3 minutes. Add the roasted coconut and saut� on a medium flame for 1 minute. Transfer the mixture into a deep bowl and keep aside to cool for at least 15 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and cardamom powder and mix well. Keep aside. For the dough, combine maida, ghee and salt and using enough water make a semi-stiff dough. Finally make the karanji. Roll a portion of the dough into a 125 mm. (5�) diameter circle without using any flour for rolling. Place approx. 1 tbsp of the stuffing in the centre. Fold it over to make a semi-circle and press the sides well. Take a sharp knife or a cutter and cut the edges to make it even. Heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan and deep-fry a few karanjis at a time on a medium flame till they turn golden brown in colour from both the sides. Drain on an absorbent paper. Cool and serve.

As the crunchy shell gives way to the sweet stuffing in Maharashtrian karanji, you are greeted by shades of spice, the crunch of nuts and of course, the delightfully flaky mouth-feel of roasted coconut and rava.

This rich Indian style coconut karanji is ideal to make for festivals like Diwali. Cool and store the Karanji in an airtight container, where it will stay good for at least 15 days.

Tips for karanji. 1. You should add bubbling hot ghee to the plain flour while making the dough for the shell, in order to get the correct crispness of the karanji. 2. When rolling each portion of the dough, make sure the remaining dough is covered with a plate, else it will dry up and crack while rolling. 3. After placing the stuffing, seal the corners of the Karanji well before deep-frying, else the stuffing will seep into the oil!

plain flour (maida) for dusting and rolling","khari biscuit recipe | puff pastry biscuit | Indian vegetarian khari biscuit | with 35 amazing images.

An evergreen accompaniment for chai, the Khari Biscuit or Puff Pastry Biscuit is something that many people think to be a speciality that only bakeries can produce.

Here we show you how to start from scratch and make wonderfully crisp and flaky Khari Biscuits right at home. The gluten, vinegar and a liberal dose of margarine are essential ingredients to get the right texture, so make sure you do not omit any of them while preparing the recipe.

We suggest some tips to make the perfect khari biscuit recipe. 1. Add vinegar. It is a bleaching agent that provides whiteness to the dough and acid helps relax the gluten in the flour which makes it easier to roll out. You can add lemon/lime juice or even citric acid powder instead of vinegar. 2. Add gluten to provide our khari biscuit dough with elasticity and stretchability that our regular flour won�t be able to provide alone. 3. Make sure you knead the dough lightly, while stretching it and pulling it for about 10 to 15 minutes or until it is smooth and glossy. 4. Again fold one side of the rectangle till the centre. It is important to work quickly through this process so that the dough will remain nice and cold and the margarine won�t melt. At any stage if the dough and butter warm up and soften, just quickly put it in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to firm up the butter again.

Pitla is a very quick and easy dish to make with minimum of ingredients. All the ingredients used in the dish are found in every Indian well maintained pantry.

The base of the Maharashtrian pitla is made with besan. The first step is combining besan with enough water to get it started. Further, for the tempering take oil in a non stick pan, add garlic which gives a luscious taste to our Maharashtrian pitla. Next, add cumin seeds and curry leaves followed by green chillies and onions. Chillies can be adjusted according to the preference of spice and onions give a mouthful to the recipe, it basically adds crunch. Once onions are cooked, add the besan water mixture, with turmeric and coriander leaves for freshness. Further all you need to do is keep stirring it and make sure the besan doesn�t stick to the bottom of the pan. And also make sure you do not leave besan pitla unattended as it might burn.

Some places in Maharashtra also serve pitla as a street food. As pitla is super easy to make, I remember as a child when my mother was a working women she would make it for dinner as it doesn�t consume time and also she would cook it when we would run out of vegetables.

Pitla goes really well with chawal bhakri, jowar roti and some green chilli thecha and red chill thecha.

There are several interesting things about this Malvani style green chana masala. The hara chana is cooked and crushed to a very convenient consistency before being used in the gravy. Then, there is the use of tamarind instead of tomatoes, which adds to the flavour and pungency without toning down the effect of the spices.

Above all what makes this Maharashtrian chana gravy more interesting is its authentic paste of dry coconut with a host of khada masala, which means whole Indian spices. The perfect proportion of each of these masalas is very important to lend a fantastic taste to this sabzi which can be combined with most Indian breads like roti, chapati and paratha.

The use of fresh cream in this Malvani hara chana masala is not very traditional, but it will help get a creamy texture and balance the spiciness as well. You can also try other chana recipes like Chana Ghassi and Kabuli Chana Stir- Fry.

This South Indian delicacy has become an integral part of Mumbai Street Food .

No dosa stall is complete without piping hot deep-fried vadas. Just ask, and can get them submerged in sambar. The idli-vada combination is a favourite for breakfast!

To make Mumbai roadside medu vada, urad dal is soaked, drained and then spices added and blended to make a smooth batter. Then small portions of urad dal vada are deep fried.

Tips to make the Mumbai roadside medu vada recipe. 1. Don�t grind the batter for too long at once as it will make the batter more like a paste and heat up the grinder resulting into hard vadas. Grind it for few seconds, stop and then grind it again for few seconds. Follow this method to grind the batter. 2. After grinding, beat the medu vada batter using your hand for 8-10 minutes in one direction. This process incorporates air which makes the vada light and fluffy. To check if the batter is fluffy enough or no, drop a portion of batter in a bowl filled with water and if it floats on the surface it means that batter is perfectly fluffy.

Besides idlis and vadas try these popular Mumbai street food dosas like Jini Dosa, Schezuan Chopsuey Dosa, Paneer Chilly Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa.

Pitla is a Maharashtrian bhaji made with gram flour (besan) and is made on day to day basis in Maharashtrian households. We have added little twist to pithla by adding chopped fenugreek leaves (methi) and made a very delicious recipe that is ""Methi Pitla"".The addition of fenugreek leaves gives an exciting twist to the otherwise traditional Maharashtrian pitla.

Methi Pitla is quick and super easy to make. I remember as a kid, when we would run out of vegetables or when mom would be in a hurry she would make this super quick Maharashtrian sabzi ""methi pitla"". When you cook the methi pitla with a little more water it is called methi zunka.

The procedure to make Maharashtrian methi che pithla is very simple. The base of the recipe is besan, so firstly besan is mixed with required water and whisked properly making sure no lumps are left. Further, oil is heated in a non-stick pan and onions and garlic paste are added. Onions give a mouthfeel to the pithla. Once the onions are cooked methi leaves are added with chillies and asafoetida. Generally methi pitla is made spicy but you can adjust the green chillies according to your preference. Lastly, besan water mixture, turmeric and red chilli powder are added. And mixed well. It is cooked together for 3-4 minutes while continuously stirring it, if you leave it unattended there are high chances of your Maharashtrian methi che pithla getting burnt or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. So, to avoid that make sure you stir and whisk it continuously.

Spicy methi pitla with chawal bhakri is the comfort food for most Maharashtrian families and a popular dish in most roadside eateries in Mumbai called the �Zunka Bhakar centres�. When I was studying in Bombay, I remember eating at the Zunka Bhakar centres on many nights when we went to the town side.

Mix and cook well for 3-4 mins and make sure you do not leave Maharashtrian methi pitla unattended and keep stirring it continuously or it may stick to the bottom of the pan or might burn. Stop cooking when you have derived the required consistency.

See why we think methi pitla is healthy? Made mainly from methi and besan, so lets understand the ingredients. Besan has more good fat than whole wheat flour and also higher
protein content. Rich in complex carbohydrates and with a low glycemic index, besan is good for diabetics too. Methi leaves are in calorie, powerful
antioxidant and cures mouth ulcers. Fenugreek leaves help in improving glucose and insulin responses, hence good for diabetics.

Make sure you serve healthy pitla immediately or with time it tends to get lumpy.

methiche pithle goes really well with chawal bhakri, jowar roti and some green chilli thecha and red chill thecha. Some households also have it with rice. So, we would suggest if you are willing to have methiche pithle with rice keep it liquidy and if you are intending to serve it with an Indian bread then keep it thick.

It�s best to make the khichdi slightly mushy by adding little extra water while pressure cooking. 4. When pressure cooking the yellow moong dal khichdi don�t cook on high flame as the khichdi will get stuck at the bottom of the pressure cooker and give a burnt taste. So cook on a medium flame. 5.

Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa | Mysore Dosa | with 65 amazing images.

This is Mumbai�s own version of Mysore masala dosa. While the traditional Mysore masala dosa features chutney-smeared dosas with a simple potato masala rolled inside it, Mumbai�s street vendors offer a more exotic version, in which crispy dosas are smeared with a sweet, spicy and tangy Mysore chutney and rolled up with a unique masala of chopped and grated veggies perked up with our very own pav bhaji masala.

This gives it an absolutely peppy and �local� taste, as well as an interesting mouth-feel! Very sumptuous, this snack is nothing short of a complete meal, when served with hot sambhar and fresh coconut chutney .

I would like to suggest 7 tips to make the perfect Mysore masala dosa. 1. In case if you have purchased the dosa batter from the market and you find it thick, then add water as required to get a pouring consistency batter. 2. Add some sooji (rava) to get crispy brown dosas. 3. Ensure that the Mysore chutney is a little thick which will help in easy spreading on the dosa. We have used around 1 cup of water for blending. 4. To make the Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa, heat a non-stick tava. Grease it with � tsp of butter. Butter for greasing is used to season the tava and form a layer that helps in easy removal of the dosa after cooking. This initial greasing is done only once before making the dosas. 5. Sprinkle little water on the tava, it should sizzle immediately. If the water is not sprinkled, the excess fat will make the spreading of Mysore masala dosa very difficult. 6. Wipe the tava using a clean muslin cloth or folded tissue. This is to clean and make the tava ready for spreading the dosa batter. If there is any fat on the tava, the dosa will not spread evenly. 7. Spread the dosa batter in a circular motion using a ladle.

From kids to elderly people everyone loves eating the mouthwatering puchka. Pani translates to water and puri are puffed crispy dough balls which are hallow. The puri�s are made in different shapes and sizes across India. It is extremely famous in cosmopolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Kolkata.

Pani Puri, have it spicy sweet or balanced � just the way you like it! it is a delight to watch the vendor skilfully punch a tiny hole in each puri thereafter adding the fillings and dipping it in the meetha chutney and teekha pani. Because of the hygiene and cleanliness issue, many people prefer making pani puri at home from scratch. The elements required for making homemade golgappa are - crispy puri, a stuffing of your choice (soaked boondi, boiled potatoes, chickpeas and moong or ragda) and pani (teekha phudina pani and sweet imli pani). There are many other versions of pani too like lehsun ka pani, jaljeera, hing jeera pani.The recipe can be modified as per your preference. If you are making a mixed sprouts stuffing for pani puri then you would require some pre-preparation of 2 days.

For our homemade pani puri, we have made everything at home from the scratch. We have started with making the puri first. To make super-crisp and perfect Puri for Pani Puri, right at home. The semolina and plain flour dough is made with chilled soda, which makes the small puris to puff up while frying. The amount of soda needed to make the dough will differ, depending on the quality of the semolina and flour, so be mindful when mixing. You will really relish the crisp texture of these puris. Once the dough is kneaded, divide it into equal portions, roll into a thin chapatti. Cut into circles using a cookie cutter and deep fry till they puff up.

To make golgappa, we have first made the teekha phudina pani, combine mint leaves (phudina), chopped coriander (dhania), lemon juice, green chillies, ginger (adrak), 2 whole black peppercorns (kalimirch), black salt (sanchal) and cumin seeds (jeera) powder in a mixer jar and blend it into a paste. Transfer the paste to a deep bowl and add 3 cups of chilled water, mix well and our teekha phudina pani is ready. You can keep it in the refrigerator and take it out when serving.

Further we have prepared mixed sprouts mixture for pani puri. Combine parboiled mixed sprouts, boondi (soaked for 10 minutes and drained), mashed potatoes, coriander-cumin seeds (dhania-jeera) powder, chilli powder and black salt (sanchal). Mix everything well. Our mixture is ready!! You can also use ragda as the filling.

To serve this mouthwatering snack pani puri you need to rack a small hole in the centre of each of the 6 puris and stuff each puri with a little mixed sprouts mixture. Top it with a little meetha chutney and dip the entire puri in the teekha phudina pani. Serve homemade pani puri immediately.

Make sure, you assemble Mumbai roadside pani puri only when you are eating it or else it will get soggy and the crispiness of the puri will be lost. Here�s a tip for the teekha phudina pani - if you have time in hand you can use room temperature water and refrigerate it for 3 to 4 hours. Chilling the pani for 3 to 4 hours enhances the flavours.

Phulkas also known as Chapatis, is the daily bread for millions of Indians. No meal is complete without Phulkas and we show you easy it is to make them.

Phulkas are Indian flatbreads made from whole wheat flour making them always healthy. Phulkas are called so because they swell up with steam while being cooked. They are cooked first on a dry hot tava, then held directly over a flame where they ""swell"" (""phulao"" in hindi) with steam to the point of bursting.

Procedure of making chapatti really easy and quick. Take whole wheat flour in a parat, add oil which will help making the chapatti soft, add salt and mix well. Further, add water and knead into a soft dough. The dough for phulka should be soft and not stiff as for puris. Also if the dough is very soft it will be sticky and you will be unable to roll. Keep the kneaded dough aside covered with a soft cloth or bowl for 15 to 20 minutes. Then divide and roll into a thin roti, cook on a tava and then open flame until it puffs up. Don�t cook on the open flame for too long or else the phulka will burn and become hard.

The phulka dough can be refrigerated for 2-3 days. The best way to refrigerate the dough is to lightly oil the dough and the bowl. The bowl you are storing the dough should be spacious and should be covered tightly to prevent it from drying.

See why we think phulka, chapatis are healthy ? Made from Whole wheat flour which is excellent for diabetics as they will not shoot up your blood sugar levels as they are a low GI food. Whole wheat flour is rich in Phosphorus which is a major mineral which works closely with calcium to build our bones.

Serve Phulkas hot with a dollop of ghee. Phulkas are light and are great to serve for lunch as well as dinner with a subzi or dal.

rotla also called bajra rotla is a Gujarati style bajra rotla. Though bajra is grown only in certain parts of Rajasthan, bajra rotlas are relished all over the country. Thickly rolled bajra rotla are cooked over ""kanda"" (cow dung cakes) in the villages. That is the authentic way of preparing them because it imparts a smoked flavour to the Bajra roti. This bajra rotla is a very famous recipe from Gujarat.

The bajra rotla are thickly rolled, cooked on a tava and then roast over open flame till brown spots appear. Traditionally white butter also known as makhan is smeared on it or if that is not available you can use ghee.

Knead the dough with warm water as the dough become pliable and easy to knead and roll. This helps in getting pearl millet roti a soft texture.

Bajra Roti is a traditional Indian flatbread made with bajra or black pearl millet flour making it extremely nutritious. Bajra flour is high in protein and is a complete protein for vegetarians when combined with dal. So as a Vegetarian, include bajra in your diet.

If you are looking for a gluten-free option, this is an ideal recipe . I remember, my grandmother would roll the rotla using her palm and cook it on a earthen clay tava on a chulha, which would give bajra rotla a smoky flavor.

I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect bajra rotla. 1. To make Gujarati style bajra rotla, take a portion of the dough and shape into a round ball. The dough ball should be smooth without any cracks. If required, you can apply some water on your palms and then shape. 2. Serve the Bajra rotla immediately smeared with white butter or ghee. If it cools down, it will feel very hard and dry.

Bajra roti, lahsun ki chutney and onions is a combo!! Although absolutely simple to make, these rotis are delicious!

Take care to make the Gujarati style bajra rotlas as soon as the dough is kneaded, as the dough tends to harden quickly, making it difficult to roll. With practice and patience, you can surely master the art of rolling the rotlas uniformly and making them puff up.

You can also serve rotlas with Baingan Bharta, Khatta Urad Dal and Red Chilli Thecha, as it makes a complete meal combo and is sure to attract everybody.

Tendli and rice combination turns even heavenly when we add the prepare Maharashtrian masala to it.

This Tendli Bhaat actually has a double dose of spices! Not only is the rice cooked with saut�ed spices, but it is also seasoned with an aromatic spice powder. The spice powder is quite special, because the regular spices like cinnamon and cloves are further enhanced by unique additions like sesame, caraway and coconut.

You can make ivy gourd rice for special occasions or also use it as a tiffin treat. It is a satisfying one-pot meal. Preparation for Tendli bhaat doesn�t make time nor does cooking. This is on my lunch box tiffin recipe atleast once a week. Also, I have a Maharashtrian friend who makes it as a gudi padwa recipe along with sol kadhi.

A satiating thalipeeth made of rajgira flour (amaranth flour) is the perfect food to have on a fasting day. Thalipeeth, a spicy and savoury pancake, popular in Western India is loaded with nutrition.

Maharashtrian upvaas thalipeeth is an all-time favourite Maharashtrian dish, which is often had for breakfast or supper. With a few small tweaks like using sendha namak instead of sea salt, it is also used to sustain oneself on a fasting day.

Popular during fasts, it's also well known as rajgira thalipeeth faraal food. It is mostly had during fasting days like Navratri, Ekadashi and Mahashivratri.

Upvas thalipeeth is quick and easy to make, take rajgira flour also known as amaranth flour in a deep bowl. Add the peeled and grated raw potatoes. Potatoes act as binding agent for your upvaas thalipeeth. Grated Potatoes are added as they give a nice mouthfeel but if you want, you can add boiled potatoes and mashed potatoes instead. Add coarsely crushed peanut for the crunch. Add green chilli paste according to your preference of spice.

We have used rock salt as this is a rajgira upvas thalipeeth . Further, add coriander, enough water and knead into a soft dough. Heat a non-stick tava, grease your hands with ghee. Place a portion of the dough on the tava (griddle) and pat it evenly with greased fingers to form a 100 mm. (4�) diameter circle. Be gentle when you are patting it to prevent cracks in your upvaas thalipeeth. You will not be able to roll the dough as it would be too sticky to be rolled out. You can either pat it on the tava directly or pat it between 2 thick plastic sheets and then place it onto the tava. Cook properly from both the sides and serve Maharashtrian upvaas thalipeeth with green faraali chutney!!

Perked up with grated potatoes and crushed peanuts, not to forget some lemon juice and green chilli paste, the rajgira faraali thalipeeth is a real treat to your palate too.

Further to cover them, we have made a thick batter using besan, turmeric powder, baking soda and little salt. Next, dip the potato balls in the batter and deep fry until golden brown. Next, to assemble vada pav, take a ladi pav and slit it from the centre, but do not cut fully. These days whole wheat laadi pav are also available in many bakery stores.. If you wish you can make them at home, check out our recipe for whole wheat laadi pav. Next, Spread some sukhi leshun ki chutney on the bottom half of the laadi pav. Place the vada over it and tradional style vada pav is ready. We have also shown the process to assemble Mumbai style vada pav, first spread some meetha chutney on a slit pav. Then spread some teekha chutney over it. Finally spread some sukhi leshun ki chutney over it. Place the vada and press the pav and the Mumbaiya style vada pav is ready to serve. Serve immediately while the vadas are still hot. You can also serve along with some fried green chillies.

These days there are many ways to make and serve the vada pav. Some vada pavs are made with an array of chutneys and some of the vada pavs are made with chutneys, topped with onions, mayonnaise and cheese while some vada pavs are served with the besan chura made from left over besan batter along with chutneys.

Succulent and spicy potato vadas are sandwiched between fresh pav bread along with dry garlic chutney, to make a delicious snack that tickles the taste buds and satisfies the tummy. I have fond memories of sharing a vada pav with my son while travelling on a business trip to Vapi by train.

Although vada pav is a Maharashtrian dish, I was surprised to find it popular even in Gujarat. Another travelling ritual on my frequent drives to Pune is to stop at a small caf� on the highway to grab a quick vada pav and a steaming hot cup of Masala Tea that chases away all my travel fatigue.

Tips on the Manchurian gravy for veg manchurian recipe . 1. Almost all Chinese cooking is done on a high flame to get an intense flavor. 2. Now add the cornflour-water mixture and cook for 3-4 minutes, while stirring occasionally. As cornflour does not dissolve in water, always stir the mixture well before adding it to any sauce or gravy. The reason for adding this is for the gravy to get thicker as it cooks. If the gravy is too thin after 3 to 4 minutes, you can add more of the cornflour-water mixture. But if the gravy is too thick, you can add more water or stock to it to adjust the consistency.

If the edges crack too much when you roll the bhakri then you may need to add some water or milk additionally to make smooth dough. 2. Make sure you cook the bhakri on low flame. If you will cook it on high or medium flame, brown spots will apprear but the bhakri will left raw from inside.

rice (chawal) bhakri","zunka recipe | jhunka | Marathi zunka bhakar | Maharashtrian zunka |

zunka is an authentic Maharashtrian delicacy which is slightly spicy but very satisfying in texture, flavour and aroma. Learn how to make Marathi zunka bhakar.

Traditional Maharashtrian and spicy, the Maharashtrian zunka is considered by many as a dry version of the famous pitla. It is like a curry of ginger, green chillies, garlic, onions and coriander perked up with a very flavourful tempering.

To make zunka, heat the oil in a deep non-stick kadhai and add the mustard seeds. When the seeds crackle, add the cumin seeds and asafoetida and saut� on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the ginger, green chillies, garlic and onions and saut� on a medium flame for 5 minutes. Add the turmeric powder, besan and salt, mix well and cook on a slow flame for 1 to 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add 1� cups of hot water and mix well. Cover with a lid and cook on a slow flame for 3 to 4 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add the coriander, mix well and keep aside. For the tempering, heat the oil in a small non-stick pan, add the mustard seeds, asafoetida and garlic and saut� on a medium flame for 1 minute. Add the curry leaves and red chillies and saut� on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the tempering to the zunka and mix well. Serve immediately with chawal bhakri.

Although a variety of spices are used, the curry leaves in the tempering lends a classic, aromatic touch to this jhunka. Serve it right off the stove with bhakri, thecha and buttermilk, as it will get dry if left for long.

Though some good quantity of oil has been used in the Marathi zunka bhakar, you can benefit from the protein in besan and also gain in some antioxidant allicin from onion and garlic.

Tips for zunka. 1. Ensure the besan has no moisture and is free of lumps, else the zunka might also turn lumpy. 2. After adding hot water at step 5, stir it instantly to get a uniform mixture. 3. The unique cooking method of tempering it twice is crucial to get an authentic taste.
