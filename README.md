# Recipe Recommendation System
This repository contains code for a recipe recommendation system implemented using Python and Streamlit.

## Description

similarity between recipes and provide personalized recommendations.

## Prerequisites
  - Python 3.x
  - Pip (Python package installer)
  - Streamlit

   cd recipe-recommendation-system
```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ``` bash pip install -r requirements.txt ```
## Usage
1. Run the Streamlit app:
  ``` bash streamlit run app.py ```
2. Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to access the recipe recommendation system.
3. Select a recipe from the dropdown menu and click the "Get Recommendations" button to view recommended recipes.
