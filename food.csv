Scrub them with the help of a brush if there is any mud and dirt stuck to it. 2. Add the baby potatoes to the boiling water and cook on a medium flame till the baby potatoes are completely cooked. They should not be very soft or else they will break on cooking. The cooking might take around 18-20 minutes on a medium flame with closed lid. 3. Add the dried mango powder for a pleasant sour (khatta) taste to the marinade. 4. Now add the besan for binding so that the potatoes don�t release water. 5. Mix gently with the help of two spoons and keep aside to marinade for 5 to 7 minutes. This is a very important step as the potatoes need to take on the flavour of the marinade. 6. Cook on a medium flame for 3 to 4 minutes, while stirring occasionally, till they are heated through and get a little browning on them. Once cooked perfectly, you can see all the masalas coat the potatoes very nicely.

besan ladoo is one of the most popular mithai in Indian cuisine. It might be known by various names, but this delicious laddoos of spiced and sweetened besan is famous all over the country.

besan ladoo are made and relished for festivals, family events and different occasions. Some people also serve besan ke ladoo as prasadam. All you need is patience while making besan ladoo, patience is the key.

Ingredients used for making besan ladoo are simply available in every Indian household pantry. All you need to do to make besan ladoo is heat ghee in a non stick pan, once the ghee is hot. Add besan and keep stirring it continuously which will prevent it from burning. Do not strictly leave it unattended. You will need to roast the besan for 13-15 mins atleast. You will know the besan is cooked when the besan would turn golden brown and has a nice aroma. Further, transfer it in a plate and let it cool down. Once the mixture has come to room temperature, add sugar. Also, add coarsely grounded almonds which would give laddus a nutty taste and finally cardamom powder which would enhance the taste of it. Mix well and roll into laddoos. The finish of the laddoos should be shiny, which is an indication of perfectly cooked besan ladoo.

When making this, remember that the rich flavour of the besan ladoo depends on how well you cook the besan. Under-cooking it will leave behind a raw taste, which will ruin the whole recipe. So, make sure you cook it well. The proportion of ghee and besan is also important as you might end up with a dry or very soft besan ladoo if it is not done right.

Once you have the mix ready, take some in your palm, shape it into a round and keep rolling it in your hand till you get a smooth, lustrous, ghee-tinted texture on the surface. besan ladoo will look so irresistible at this stage that you would just want to pop it into your mouth!

To make whole wheat chapati recipe, combine the whole wheat flour, oil and salt and knead into a smooth soft dough using enough water. Keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes.

Cook the chapati on a non stick tava and then cook it on an open flame till it puffs up. This is how to make soft chapati.

I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect chapati recipe. 1. For making the chapati dough, take a deep bowl and add the flour to it.We need to take a deep bowl so that the flour and the other ingredients do not fall off while we are mixing or kneading the dough. 2. Some people like their chapatis bland ,so you can even skip adding salt to your chapati dough. 3. Add water little by little. Be careful while adding water.Adding too much of water initially will make it difficult for you to knead. 4. Apply a little oil on the surface of the dough before you keep it for resting, so that it doesn�t become dry. Cover the dough with a wet muslin cloth. You can also use a food grade quality cling film or a plate to cover the dough. 5. Keep it aside for 15 minutes. This resting period improves the texture of the dough, makes it easier to roll and makes the chapatis softer and fluffier.

We love whole wheat chapati as its quick to make and very healthy.

A lip-smacking chaat that is loved all over India, and now globally too, the chole tikki chaat is most enjoyed at roadside stalls, but is definitely more satisfying when you make it at home for your family or for a party.

Notes and tips on aloo tikki chole. 1. To make the Chole for the Chole Tikki Chaat, we first have to soak the kabuli chana. For that, wash the kabuli chana thoroughly under running water. Once washed, place them in a deep bowl. Cover them with enough water. We have taken approximately � cup of chickpeas as they will double on size once they are soaked and cooked. Cover the bowl with a plate and keep aside to soak for at least 8 hours or overnight. This is a very important step as this not only helps in cooking the chickpeas faster but also helps in cooking them evenly. 2. If you want the chickpeas to go soft, you can add a pinch of baking soda while pressure cooking so that the chickpeas cook properly. But remember you do not want the chickpeas to go mushy. 3. Wait for the pressure to drop naturally before opening it. If you open it in a haste, the chickpeas will not have cooked properly. 4. Make sure that your pan is really hot so that you get a nice crust on your tikkis.

You will love the exciting crispness of these delectable dal vadas. Made with a coarse paste of soaked chana dal perked up with onions, ginger paste and the whole traditional team of flavour enhancers and deep fried, these South Indian dal vadas have a unique, rustic texture and warm, hearty flavour that will strike a chord with most people.

I would like to share some important tips to make chana dal vada. 1. Blend the chana dal to a coarse mixture without using any water. If required, once in between you can scrape the sides of the mixer jar and grind the mixture again. Try not to add water, as you will face difficulty in shaping the dal vada at a later stage. But if it is getting too problematic to grind, then add 1-2 tbsp of water. 2. Mix everything well and our paruppu vadai mixture is ready. Mixture should not be very moist or dry. If the mixture is too crumbly or too pasty then it would be difficult to make vadas from this mixture. If the mixture has turned crumbly, then grind it once again and if the mixture has turned pasty then add 1-2 tbsp of rice flour or besan to bind together all the ingredients. At this stage, you can taste the mixture and make the necessary changes in the flavour as per your liking. 3. Take care to deep-fry these South Indian dal vadas on a medium flame. Otherwise, they will quickly turn brown outside before they get cooked inside.

These deep fried dal vadas are sure to satiate you in a tasteful way, have them for Evening Tea Snacks accompained with Green Chutney or Tomato Coconut Chutney.

It has been made with love and care in Maharashtrian homes since several generations, and is a dish that instantly connects a person with memories of home, childhood, mom�s cooking and such sentiments.

This wholesome dish is made with three different flours � jowar, whole wheat and besan. It is excitingly flavoured with lots of onion, garlic and coriander, which not only give an irresistible flavour and aroma but a lovely mouth-feel too.

You can go a step further and improvise it to your taste, by adding flavourers like mint, cumin seeds, or any other spices and seeds of your choice. We have added a little curd to give a tempting sourness to the dish, but you can avoid it if you do not want to.

Likewise, you can also make a paste of garlic and green chillies if you do not want to add them chopped. Sometimes, chopped green chillies can be irksome especially if kids will also be having the thalipeeth.

By the way, in case you are wondering why the dish is called Dhapate (which means slap or pat), your doubts will be dispelled once you read the procedure. This pancake is shaped by patting the dough with the hand. Earlier, they used to pat it directly on the hot tava with wet hands, but to make it easier we have shown you how to pat it on a plastic sheet and then transfer to the tava. This is much easier.

Enjoy this authentic Maharashtrian Thalipeeth hot and fresh to relish its satiating taste and texture. It is homely and satisfying, guaranteed to please both young and old.

The goda masala is a Maharashtrian goda masala, the Maharashtrian version of garam masala. goda masala is used in several traditional Maharashtrian dishes, to give a tongue-tickling flavour and appetising aroma.

goda masala has a whole lot of ingredients, but you can add or remove some of these as per your preference and taste. Some people, for example, add triphal too to this masala. You can use Byadagi chillies instead of Kashmiri chillies if you want less spice and a deep colour. So, what we have given you is a basic Maharashtrian goda masala recipe that you can modify as per your taste.

What is important is to split the ingredients into three groups when making Maharashtrian goda masala � one that needs to be dry-roasted, one that needs to be roasted with oil, and finally the group that needs to be added directly. Then, you can process each group and grind.

Notes on goda masala. 1. When the pan is moderately hot, dry roast coriander seeds on a slow flame for 3 minutes or till they release aroma and turn light brown in colour, while stirring continuously. Transfer into a deep bowl. Ensure you don�t brown them a lot. 2. Make sure the roasted stuff is cooled completely before grinding Maharashtrian goda masala to avoid lumps.

Use this aromatic goda masala to make authentic Maharashtrian dishes like Panchamrut, Misal and Batata Ani Flower Cha Rassa.

We have used hot water for kneading the dough as it helps in getting the roti soft and even when not served for hours, it doesn't become hard or chewy. But you also need to make sure that you roll out the roti immediately after kneading the dough as if you would keep the dough for a long time, it will loose its moisture and would become splintery which would make rolling difficult.

An evergreen accompaniment for chai, the Khari Biscuit or Puff Pastry Biscuit is something that many people think to be a speciality that only bakeries can produce.

Here we show you how to start from scratch and make wonderfully crisp and flaky Khari Biscuits right at home. The gluten, vinegar and a liberal dose of margarine are essential ingredients to get the right texture, so make sure you do not omit any of them while preparing the recipe.

We suggest some tips to make the perfect khari biscuit recipe. 1. Add vinegar. It is a bleaching agent that provides whiteness to the dough and acid helps relax the gluten in the flour which makes it easier to roll out. You can add lemon/lime juice or even citric acid powder instead of vinegar. 2. Add gluten to provide our khari biscuit dough with elasticity and stretchability that our regular flour won�t be able to provide alone. 3. Make sure you knead the dough lightly, while stretching it and pulling it for about 10 to 15 minutes or until it is smooth and glossy. 4. Again fold one side of the rectangle till the centre. It is important to work quickly through this process so that the dough will remain nice and cold and the margarine won�t melt. At any stage if the dough and butter warm up and soften, just quickly put it in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to firm up the butter again.

Besides tea you can enjoy Indian vegetarian khari biscuit with a spread of one of your favourite jams or Dips and Sauces .

To make Malvani chana masala, first make the Malvani paste. Combine the Kashmiri chillies, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cloves, caraway seeds, cardamom, black cardamom, poppy seeds, star anise, cinnamon and dry coconut in a non-stick pan and dry roast on a medium flame for 3 minutes or till the masalas release an aroma. Keep aside to cool slightly. Blend in a mixer to a smooth paste using � cup of water. Keep aside. Then blend 1 cup of hara chana in a mixer to a coarse mixture and keep aside.

There are several interesting things about this Malvani style green chana masala. The hara chana is cooked and crushed to a very convenient consistency before being used in the gravy. Then, there is the use of tamarind instead of tomatoes, which adds to the flavour and pungency without toning down the effect of the spices.

Above all what makes this Maharashtrian chana gravy more interesting is its authentic paste of dry coconut with a host of khada masala, which means whole Indian spices. The perfect proportion of each of these masalas is very important to lend a fantastic taste to this sabzi which can be combined with most Indian breads like roti, chapati and paratha.

The use of fresh cream in this Malvani hara chana masala is not very traditional, but it will help get a creamy texture and balance the spiciness as well. You can also try other chana recipes like Chana Ghassi and Kabuli Chana Stir- Fry.

Tips for Malvani chana masala. 1. As a variation to Malvani style green chana masala, you can replace hara chana with kala chana which is commonly also known as brown chick peas. 2. Use of Kashmiri chillies is a must for the bright red colour of this sabzi.

Mumbai roadside medu vada is a highly popular street food and we show you how to make Step by Step medu vada recipe.

This South Indian delicacy has become an integral part of Mumbai Street Food .

No dosa stall is complete without piping hot deep-fried vadas. Just ask, and can get them submerged in sambar. The idli-vada combination is a favourite for breakfast!

To make Mumbai roadside medu vada, urad dal is soaked, drained and then spices added and blended to make a smooth batter. Then small portions of urad dal vada are deep fried.

Tips to make the Mumbai roadside medu vada recipe. 1. Don�t grind the batter for too long at once as it will make the batter more like a paste and heat up the grinder resulting into hard vadas. Grind it for few seconds, stop and then grind it again for few seconds. Follow this method to grind the batter. 2. After grinding, beat the medu vada batter using your hand for 8-10 minutes in one direction. This process incorporates air which makes the vada light and fluffy. To check if the batter is fluffy enough or no, drop a portion of batter in a bowl filled with water and if it floats on the surface it means that batter is perfectly fluffy.

Besides idlis and vadas try these popular Mumbai street food dosas like Jini Dosa, Schezuan Chopsuey Dosa, Paneer Chilly Dosa and Mysore Masala Dosa.

Pitla is a Maharashtrian bhaji made with gram flour (besan) and is made on day to day basis in Maharashtrian households. We have added little twist to pithla by adding chopped fenugreek leaves (methi) and made a very delicious recipe that is ""Methi Pitla"".The addition of fenugreek leaves gives an exciting twist to the otherwise traditional Maharashtrian pitla.

Methi Pitla is quick and super easy to make. I remember as a kid, when we would run out of vegetables or when mom would be in a hurry she would make this super quick Maharashtrian sabzi ""methi pitla"". When you cook the methi pitla with a little more water it is called methi zunka.

The procedure to make Maharashtrian methi che pithla is very simple. The base of the recipe is besan, so firstly besan is mixed with required water and whisked properly making sure no lumps are left. Further, oil is heated in a non-stick pan and onions and garlic paste are added. Onions give a mouthfeel to the pithla. Once the onions are cooked methi leaves are added with chillies and asafoetida. Generally methi pitla is made spicy but you can adjust the green chillies according to your preference. Lastly, besan water mixture, turmeric and red chilli powder are added. And mixed well. It is cooked together for 3-4 minutes while continuously stirring it, if you leave it unattended there are high chances of your Maharashtrian methi che pithla getting burnt or it will stick to the bottom of the pan. So, to avoid that make sure you stir and whisk it continuously.

Spicy methi pitla with chawal bhakri is the comfort food for most Maharashtrian families and a popular dish in most roadside eateries in Mumbai called the �Zunka Bhakar centres�. When I was studying in Bombay, I remember eating at the Zunka Bhakar centres on many nights when we went to the town side.

Serve Methi Pithla with jowar bhakri and accompany it with onions and red chill thecha.

Some important points i would like to share with you on moong dal khichdi recipe.1. Take a pressure cooker and add the dal to it. We have used moong dal, but many people use a combination of toor dal, green moong dal or masoor dal. 2.To increase the nutritive value, you can add a myriad of vegetables like peas, carrots, beans, onions to the khichdi. 3.

Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa | Mysore Dosa | with 65 amazing images.

This is Mumbai�s own version of Mysore masala dosa. While the traditional Mysore masala dosa features chutney-smeared dosas with a simple potato masala rolled inside it, Mumbai�s street vendors offer a more exotic version, in which crispy dosas are smeared with a sweet, spicy and tangy Mysore chutney and rolled up with a unique masala of chopped and grated veggies perked up with our very own pav bhaji masala.

This gives it an absolutely peppy and �local� taste, as well as an interesting mouth-feel! Very sumptuous, this snack is nothing short of a complete meal, when served with hot sambhar and fresh coconut chutney .

I would like to suggest 7 tips to make the perfect Mysore masala dosa. 1. In case if you have purchased the dosa batter from the market and you find it thick, then add water as required to get a pouring consistency batter. 2. Add some sooji (rava) to get crispy brown dosas. 3. Ensure that the Mysore chutney is a little thick which will help in easy spreading on the dosa. We have used around 1 cup of water for blending. 4. To make the Mumbai style roadside Mysore masala dosa, heat a non-stick tava. Grease it with � tsp of butter. Butter for greasing is used to season the tava and form a layer that helps in easy removal of the dosa after cooking. This initial greasing is done only once before making the dosas. 5. Sprinkle little water on the tava, it should sizzle immediately. If the water is not sprinkled, the excess fat will make the spreading of Mysore masala dosa very difficult. 6. Wipe the tava using a clean muslin cloth or folded tissue. This is to clean and make the tava ready for spreading the dosa batter. If there is any fat on the tava, the dosa will not spread evenly. 7. Spread the dosa batter in a circular motion using a ladle.

paneer dosa is a popular Indian breakfast paneer dosa recipe. You can think of paneer dosa as a Chinese counterpart for the popular Masala Dosa, just that the usual potato masala is replaced with a fiery paneer chilli stuffing.

The paneer chilli dosa stuffing has a spicy flavour and a wonderful texture, thanks to veggies like capsicum, cabbage, tomatoes, and more. It is important to use tomato ketchup in the paneer dosa stuffing because it balances the spiciness of the chillies.

Notes on paneer dosa. 1. Add cabbage. Make use of any vegetables of your choice like baby corn, purple cabbage, bell pepper, carrot to give a nice bite to the spicy paneer chilly stuffing. 2. Add the paneer. Replace cottage cheese with tofu to make it vegan. 3. You can buy readymade paneer from a local dairy or supermarket in fresh or frozen form. In case the frozen paneer is too hard, submerge it in hot water for 15-20 minutes and get a soft texture. 4.To prepare paneer chilly dosa, we are using readymade dosa batter. We will add a little salt and adjust the consistency by adding a little water, mix well and keep aside. If using batter stored in the fridge then bring it to room temperature and then make dosa. This is very important or else you won�t get brown crispy dosa.

Phulkas also known as Chapatis, is the daily bread for millions of Indians. No meal is complete without Phulkas and we show you easy it is to make them.

Phulkas are Indian flatbreads made from whole wheat flour making them always healthy. Phulkas are called so because they swell up with steam while being cooked. They are cooked first on a dry hot tava, then held directly over a flame where they ""swell"" (""phulao"" in hindi) with steam to the point of bursting.

Procedure of making chapatti really easy and quick. Take whole wheat flour in a parat, add oil which will help making the chapatti soft, add salt and mix well. Further, add water and knead into a soft dough. The dough for phulka should be soft and not stiff as for puris. Also if the dough is very soft it will be sticky and you will be unable to roll. Keep the kneaded dough aside covered with a soft cloth or bowl for 15 to 20 minutes. Then divide and roll into a thin roti, cook on a tava and then open flame until it puffs up. Don�t cook on the open flame for too long or else the phulka will burn and become hard.

The phulka dough can be refrigerated for 2-3 days. The best way to refrigerate the dough is to lightly oil the dough and the bowl. The bowl you are storing the dough should be spacious and should be covered tightly to prevent it from drying.

See why we think phulka, chapatis are healthy ? Made from Whole wheat flour which is excellent for diabetics as they will not shoot up your blood sugar levels as they are a low GI food. Whole wheat flour is rich in Phosphorus which is a major mineral which works closely with calcium to build our bones.

To make piyush, combine shrikhand, unsalted buttermilk, sugar, cardamom powder and nutmeg powder in a deep bowl and whisk well. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Pour equal quantities of the drink in 4 individual glasses and serve chilled garnished with pistachios and saffron.

Homemade Gujarati piyush tastes like nectar, and nothing short of it, especially on a hot summer�s day when you are on a fast. This faraal recipe keeps you full for quite some time, as it is made with sumptuous ingredients like shrikhand and fresh buttermilk. Make it on occasions like Mahashivratri, Janmashtami or Ekadashi for upvas.

The assortment of spices used, especially kesar, give the piyush drink a very rich hue and flavour. We have garnished with pistachios, as they contrast in colour and show up well against the Piyush, but you can use other nuts as well.

Poha Chivda is made from an assortment of ingredients ranging from poha, roasted urad dal and peanuts to cashews and curry leaves. This gives poha chivda a range of textures, while a choice of spice powders gives it a nice savoury aroma and flavour.

Pop a spoonful into your mouth and savour the crunchiness of this delectable thin poha chivda snack! I always prefer to make snacks at home. Store bought or street bought snacks are cooked in inferior quality oil which causes inflammation of the body. This roasted poha chivda is not deep fried and hence a lot healthier than deep fried snacks.

While it is perfect to have on a cold, rainy day, with a cup of chai , this versatile poha chivda snack is also light enough to enjoy on a hot summer�s day with a glass of juice, or to take along to school or office in a snack box!

You can prepare a batch of this thin poha chivda and store it in an airtight container for a 10 to 15 days to relish it as and when you wish to. Looking for Indian travel food dry snacks, then this maharashtrian poha chivda is a perfect choice.

When making roasted poha chivda, you need to take care. Dry roast the thin beaten rice on a medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes, while stirring continuously. If you stir too much, the thin poha might break so, make use of a pan with handles and toast by shaking the pan.

Other Ingredients For Ragda Patties
4 tbsp sweet chutney
4 tsp green chutney

4 tbsp sev
4 tbsp finely chopped onions","Method
For the ragda
For making the ragda, soak the dried white peas and keep them overnight.
Drain the peas using a strainer and discard the water.
Put the soaked peas in a pressure cooker, add approximately 2� cups of water and pressure cook for 6 whistles or until the peas are soft. It is very important for the peas to be soft for this stuffed ragda patties recipe to ensure it is properly enjoyed by all.
Allow all the steam to escape before opening the lid. This is called the natural release method and is done by removing the pressure cooker from the hot burner and let the pressure drop by cooling down naturally.
Now we have to prepare the tempering to which we will add the peas. For the, heat the oil in a deep non-stick pan, add the mustard seeds, curry leaves and asafoetida and saute for 30 seconds.
Add the potatoes, mix well and saute on a medium flame for 30 seconds.
Add the cooked peas, turmeric powder, chilli powder, ginger-green chilli paste, garam masala, tamarind and salt, if required, mix well and cook on a medium flame for 3 minutes, while stirring occasionally.
Switch off the flame and keep aside.

For the patties
For making the patties, combine the mint leaves, coriander in a deep bowl.
Add the ginger paste and green chilli paste and mix well using hands so that the pastes are evenly distributed.
Add the lemon juice, sugar and salt in a deep bowl and mix well. Keep aside.
Combine the boiled, peeled and mashed potatoes, cornflour and salt to taste in a deep mixing bowl.
Knead this mixture into a soft dough. Since the potatoes are very soft, its hard to give them a definite shape, that�s why we add cornflour the potatoes to ensure proper binding.
Divide the dough into 8 equal portions.
Take one portion and carefully flatten it between the palms of both your hands, making sure it does not break.
Place 2 tsp of the mint leaves and coriander mixture in the center of the flatten potato mixture.
Bring together the edges while lightly pressing the centre so that the filling does not fall out from the patty.
Completely seal the filling inside the potato and lightly press it again in between the palms of both hands to form a patty.
Repeat steps 5 to 8 to make 7 more patties.
Heat 1 tbsp oil on a tava (griddle).
Once the oil is hot, place the patties on the tava and let them cook on a medium flame for 2 to 3 minutes till golden brown on one side.
Turn the patties, drizzle with 1 tbsp of oil and let them cook on the other side on a medium flame for 2 minutes till golden brown.

How to proceed making the ragda patties.
For serving the ragda patties, place 2 patties in a shallow serving plate.
Pour 1/4th of the ragda evenly over it.
Drizzle 1 tbsp of sweet chutney, 1 tsp of green chutney and 1 tsp of garlic chutney evenly over the ragda.
Sprinkle 1 tbsp of sev evenly over it.
Top with 2 tbsp of finely chopped onions for the crunch.
Repeat steps 1 to 5 to make 3 more servings of ragda patties.

rajgira paneer paratha is a perfect main meal during fast. Learn how to make vrat ka paratha.

A sumptuous recipe that is sure to satiate you even on a fasting day! Here in vrat ka paratha, wholesome rajgira parathas are stuffed with a succulent mixture of grated paneer perked up with green chillies, lemon juice and coriander.

What makes this upvas ka paratha very appealing is that the rotis are made of a dough of rajgira flour and potatoes, which gives them a unique texture that is soft yet crisp.

To make rajgira paneer paratha, farali paratha, combine paneer, green chillies, lemon juice, powdered sugar, coriander and salt and mix well. Combine the rajgira flour, potatoes, pepper powder and rock salt in a bowl and knead into a semi-soft dough using enough water. Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Roll out a portion of the dough into a 75 mm. (3�) diameter circle, using a little rajgira flour for rolling. Place a portion of the stuffing in the centre of the circle, bring the edges in the centre and seal tightly. Roll out again into a 100 mm. (4�) diameter circle, using a little rajgira flour for rolling. Heat a non-stick tava (griddle) and cook the paratha, using a little oil, till it turns golden brown in colour from both the sides.

The use of lemon juice and sugar further adds slight tang and sweet flavours to the otherwise bland paneer. All this Navratri fasting recipe needs is green chutney as an accompaniment.

Tips for rajgira paneer paratha, farali paratha. 1. Add water to knead dough gradually, as even a slightly soft dough might make rolling difficult. 2. Rolling semi-soft rajgira dough is also slightly difficult. It needs a little practice. We suggest you roll with a thin rolling pin and with light pressure. 3. Use fresh paneer only, for best results and perfect smooth texture. 4. If you don�t have powdered sugar, grind the table sugar in a mixer and sieve it before use.

rotla also called bajra rotla is a Gujarati style bajra rotla. Though bajra is grown only in certain parts of Rajasthan, bajra rotlas are relished all over the country. Thickly rolled bajra rotla are cooked over ""kanda"" (cow dung cakes) in the villages. That is the authentic way of preparing them because it imparts a smoked flavour to the Bajra roti. This bajra rotla is a very famous recipe from Gujarat.

The bajra rotla are thickly rolled, cooked on a tava and then roast over open flame till brown spots appear. Traditionally white butter also known as makhan is smeared on it or if that is not available you can use ghee.

Knead the dough with warm water as the dough become pliable and easy to knead and roll. This helps in getting pearl millet roti a soft texture.

Bajra Roti is a traditional Indian flatbread made with bajra or black pearl millet flour making it extremely nutritious. Bajra flour is high in protein and is a complete protein for vegetarians when combined with dal. So as a Vegetarian, include bajra in your diet.

If you are looking for a gluten-free option, this is an ideal recipe . I remember, my grandmother would roll the rotla using her palm and cook it on a earthen clay tava on a chulha, which would give bajra rotla a smoky flavor.

I would like to share some important tips to make the perfect bajra rotla. 1. To make Gujarati style bajra rotla, take a portion of the dough and shape into a round ball. The dough ball should be smooth without any cracks. If required, you can apply some water on your palms and then shape. 2. Serve the Bajra rotla immediately smeared with white butter or ghee. If it cools down, it will feel very hard and dry.

Bajra roti, lahsun ki chutney and onions is a combo!! Although absolutely simple to make, these rotis are delicious!

Take care to make the Gujarati style bajra rotlas as soon as the dough is kneaded, as the dough tends to harden quickly, making it difficult to roll. With practice and patience, you can surely master the art of rolling the rotlas uniformly and making them puff up.

You can also serve rotlas with Baingan Bharta, Khatta Urad Dal and Red Chilli Thecha, as it makes a complete meal combo and is sure to attract everybody.

Samo has too many names and people known it different. Bengali �Shamula, Gujarati � Sama, Hindi � Shama, Marathi � Shamul, Tamil � Kudirai Valu, Telugu � Bonta Chamalu and other names � Barnyard Millet / Samvat ke Chawal.

Ginger and green chillies give this moraiya khichdi an element of spice, while peanuts contribute crunch, flavour and aroma to this delightful dish. Serve the sanwa khichdi immediately, as millet-based dishes sometimes get lumpy on cooling.

Maharashtrians tradionally have their samo khichdi (called bhagar khichdi ) along the farali peanut chutney, but you can also have it along rajgira kadhi and curd.

Maharashtrian shrikhand is a magical transformation of simple curds into a delicacy, by a simple procedure. It involves no cooking and is a standard feature of sunday meals,, festive menus as well as faraal foods!

Notes on Maharashtrian shrikhand recipe. 1. Using thick curd gives a creamier shrikhand. Make sure to use fresh curd and not a sour one or else the shrikhand will be sour. 2. Hang this dahi, preferably in a cool place, over a bowl, and let it stay that way for at least 2-3 hours. This is to remove the whey from the dahi. This whey (liquid) is what makes the curd loose and watery. Once removed, the curd will be super thick and creamy. 3. If your curd is not thick, you might have to keep it hanging for longer. Some people even hang it overnight. 4. Rub the saffron strands into the milk till it dissolves. This is what will give the color and flavor to this Maharashtrian Shrikhand. ?Keep aside for 5-10 minutes for the color to come. 5. We will finally add cardamom to this. Kesar and elaichi together is one of the best combinations for Indian sweets. These spices, combined with hung curd and sugar, make an irresistible Gujarati Shrikhand

This is on my lunch box tiffin recipe atleast once a week. Also, I have a Maharashtrian friend who makes it as a gudi padwa recipe along with sol kadhi.

Adding half the spice powder when cooking the rice and tendli, and adding the remaining at the end, improves the aroma and flavour of the Maharashtrian tendli bhaat wonderfully. You could try the same tendli bhaat with other veggies, but tendli offers a special, crisp texture that is difficult to match!

Enjoy this Maharashtrian delicacy with curds and your favourite Aachar by the side.

A satiating thalipeeth made of rajgira flour (amaranth flour) is the perfect food to have on a fasting day. Thalipeeth, a spicy and savoury pancake, popular in Western India is loaded with nutrition.

Maharashtrian upvaas thalipeeth is an all-time favourite Maharashtrian dish, which is often had for breakfast or supper. With a few small tweaks like using sendha namak instead of sea salt, it is also used to sustain oneself on a fasting day.

Popular during fasts, it's also well known as rajgira thalipeeth faraal food. It is mostly had during fasting days like Navratri, Ekadashi and Mahashivratri.

Upvas thalipeeth is quick and easy to make, take rajgira flour also known as amaranth flour in a deep bowl. Add the peeled and grated raw potatoes. Potatoes act as binding agent for your upvaas thalipeeth. Grated Potatoes are added as they give a nice mouthfeel but if you want, you can add boiled potatoes and mashed potatoes instead. Add coarsely crushed peanut for the crunch. Add green chilli paste according to your preference of spice.

We have used rock salt as this is a rajgira upvas thalipeeth . Further, add coriander, enough water and knead into a soft dough. Heat a non-stick tava, grease your hands with ghee. Place a portion of the dough on the tava (griddle) and pat it evenly with greased fingers to form a 100 mm. (4�) diameter circle. Be gentle when you are patting it to prevent cracks in your upvaas thalipeeth. You will not be able to roll the dough as it would be too sticky to be rolled out. You can either pat it on the tava directly or pat it between 2 thick plastic sheets and then place it onto the tava. Cook properly from both the sides and serve Maharashtrian upvaas thalipeeth with green faraali chutney!!

Perked up with grated potatoes and crushed peanuts, not to forget some lemon juice and green chilli paste, the rajgira faraali thalipeeth is a real treat to your palate too.

Remember to season your upvaas thalipeeth with rock salt, and garnish generously with chopped coriander for a perky aroma! Serve it hot with tasty green chutney.

406,Vada Pav recipe - How to make Vada Pav,Vada Pav,Tarla Dalal,"vada pav recipe | Mumbai style vada pav | batata vada pav | wada pav | with amazing 26 amazing pictures.

Mumbai�s very own burger, Mumbai style vada pav. The vada pav recipe is made of a spicy potato filling deep fried in a gram flour batter. Along with a hot and spicy garlic chutney, batata vada pav is served inside a small ""Ladi Pav"". This indigenous burger-like snack is the quickest and tastiest meal you can have in Mumbai � any time you are hungry, even in the middle of the night!

The Vada Pav has become so famous that it is now a popular snack all over the country and features on the menus of Indian restaurants even abroad. Remember to use freshly chopped ginger, garlic and green chillies to get the perfect taste. Vada pav is a famous Mumbai Street Food and a vendor is found selling vada pav on every other Mumbai street and on railway stations.

Craving for vada pav and wanting it to be ultra hygienic? There is no better way than making batata vada pav at home as it is definitely hygienic and the ingredients used are also fresh. The procedure to make Mumbai style vada pav is not at all complex but very simple. First, we have started with making the potato filling by pounding the green chillies, ginger and garlic using a mortar and pestle. Further, heat the oil and add the mustard seeds. When they crackle, add the asafoetida and curry leaves. Add the pounded mixture which will give a unique flavor to our vada pav. Add the potatoes, turmeric powder for the colour and salt and mix well. Remove from the fire and let it cool. Divide and shape into rounds balls and keep aside. Further to cover them, we have made a thick batter using besan, turmeric powder, baking soda and little salt. Next, dip the potato balls in the batter and deep fry until golden brown. Next, to assemble vada pav, take a ladi pav and slit it from the centre, but do not cut fully. These days whole wheat laadi pav are also available in many bakery stores.. If you wish you can make them at home, check out our recipe for whole wheat laadi pav. Next, Spread some sukhi leshun ki chutney on the bottom half of the laadi pav. Place the vada over it and tradional style vada pav is ready. We have also shown the process to assemble Mumbai style vada pav, first spread some meetha chutney on a slit pav. Then spread some teekha chutney over it. Finally spread some sukhi leshun ki chutney over it. Place the vada and press the pav and the Mumbaiya style vada pav is ready to serve. Serve immediately while the vadas are still hot. You can also serve along with some fried green chillies.

These days there are many ways to make and serve the vada pav. Some vada pavs are made with an array of chutneys and some of the vada pavs are made with chutneys, topped with onions, mayonnaise and cheese while some vada pavs are served with the besan chura made from left over besan batter along with chutneys.

Succulent and spicy potato vadas are sandwiched between fresh pav bread along with dry garlic chutney, to make a delicious snack that tickles the taste buds and satisfies the tummy. I have fond memories of sharing a vada pav with my son while travelling on a business trip to Vapi by train.

Although vada pav is a Maharashtrian dish, I was surprised to find it popular even in Gujarat. Another travelling ritual on my frequent drives to Pune is to stop at a small caf� on the highway to grab a quick vada pav and a steaming hot cup of Masala Tea that chases away all my travel fatigue.

veg frankie is one of Mumbai�s most famous roadside foods and its a very appetising experience to watch the Frankie-wala deftly preparing one.

The rotis are made beforehand, but cooked again with butter before making the veg frankie. It�s not just the masaledar potato mixture that makes the Frankie so tasty but also the crunch of onions and the tangy masala water that�s sprinkled on it.

When you want a veg sandwich but are in no mood to settle for a plain one, go for this snazzy Veg Toast Sandwich which is actually a veg masala toast sandwich.

Here, in veg toast sandwich generously buttered bread slices are sandwiched with juicy and crunchy vegetable slices and a dash of peppy chutneys and sandwich masala, and toasted till it acquires a wonderful golden hue, an aroma that makes you drool and a flavour that deserves the highest ranking!

A garnish of crunchy sev adds to the drool-worthiness of this mumbai aloo sandwich snack. Make sure this veg toast sandwich is served immediately upon toasting, because the chutneys will tend to make the crisp bread soggy after a while.

You can see lines of Mumbaikar�s line up even in the peak of summer at Breach Candy, Juhu and many other places for this veg masala toast sandwich.

Bhakhris are a staple food to many. This popular Indian bread is known as Maharashtrian Bhakri and Gujarati Bhakri. whole wheat bhakri are best had hot and fresh.

I would like to share some tips to make the perfect bhakri. 1. With the help of a rolling pin, roll the dough into a 100 mm. (4"") diameter thick circle. It should be thicker than paratha. If the edges crack too much when you roll the bhakri then you may need to add some water or milk additionally to make smooth dough. 2. Make sure you cook the bhakri on low flame. If you will cook it on high or medium flame, brown spots will apprear but the bhakri will left raw from inside.

Soft Gujarati Bhakhri are served hot with Trevti Dal for lunch/dinner. It is also a popular Gujarati breakfast relished with a cup of Masala Chai.

zunka is an authentic Maharashtrian delicacy which is slightly spicy but very satisfying in texture, flavour and aroma. Learn how to make Marathi zunka bhakar.

Traditional Maharashtrian and spicy, the Maharashtrian zunka is considered by many as a dry version of the famous pitla. It is like a curry of ginger, green chillies, garlic, onions and coriander perked up with a very flavourful tempering.

To make zunka, heat the oil in a deep non-stick kadhai and add the mustard seeds. When the seeds crackle, add the cumin seeds and asafoetida and saut� on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the ginger, green chillies, garlic and onions and saut� on a medium flame for 5 minutes. Add the turmeric powder, besan and salt, mix well and cook on a slow flame for 1 to 2 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add 1� cups of hot water and mix well. Cover with a lid and cook on a slow flame for 3 to 4 minutes, while stirring occasionally. Add the coriander, mix well and keep aside. For the tempering, heat the oil in a small non-stick pan, add the mustard seeds, asafoetida and garlic and saut� on a medium flame for 1 minute. Add the curry leaves and red chillies and saut� on a medium flame for a few seconds. Add the tempering to the zunka and mix well. Serve immediately with chawal bhakri.

Although a variety of spices are used, the curry leaves in the tempering lends a classic, aromatic touch to this jhunka. Serve it right off the stove with bhakri, thecha and buttermilk, as it will get dry if left for long.

Though some good quantity of oil has been used in the Marathi zunka bhakar, you can benefit from the protein in besan and also gain in some antioxidant allicin from onion and garlic.

Tips for zunka. 1. Ensure the besan has no moisture and is free of lumps, else the zunka might also turn lumpy. 2. After adding hot water at step 5, stir it instantly to get a uniform mixture. 3. The unique cooking method of tempering it twice is crucial to get an authentic taste.
